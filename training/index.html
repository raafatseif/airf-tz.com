<p><strong>2. Customer Relation Management (Customer Care)</strong></p>
<p>Customer service is an integral part of our job and should not be seen as an extension of it. An organization’s most vital asset is its customers. Without them, we would not and could not exist in business. When you satisfy your customers, they not only help you grow by continuing to do business with them, but recommend you to friends and associates. Good customer relationship management entails careful customer care and building customer satisfaction, loyalty and retaining them. Customer satisfaction and loyalty are directly tied to the quality and value of your services. Value of your services is measured by your customer through technical and emotional attributes in relation to the cost. In this course strategies for customer care and customer relation management using Ten Commandments of customer care will be dealt in detail.</p>
<p><strong>3. Negotiation Skills</strong></p>
<p>There are many reasons why you may want to negotiate and there are several ways to approach it. A negotiation is an interactive communication process that may take place whenever we want something from someone else or another person wants something from us. Negotiation is usually considered as a compromise to settle an argument or issue to benefit ourselves as much as possible and every one to leave with a perception of a Better-Alternative-To-A-Negotiated-Settlement. Communication is always the link that will be used to negotiate the issue/argument whether it is face-to-face, on the telephone or in writing. Common mistakes during negotiation and strategies including Ten Commandments for negotiation will be taught in this course.</p>

Some of the benefits include</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>13. Transformation and Organization restructuring (Change Management) and Competitiveness</strong></p>
<p>Transformation is defined as the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical contemporary measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed. Transformation is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management">management</a> approach aiming at improvements by means of elevating efficiency and effectiveness of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process">processes</a> that exist within and across organizations. Transformation derives its existence from different disciplines such as organization, technology, strategy, and people.  The key to transformation is for organizations to look at their business processes from a “clean sheet” perspective and determine how they can best construct these processes to improve business performance.</p>
<p>This course elucidates four main types of processes which can be transformed. Some processes are core and others are non-core: namely Strategic, Operational, Managerial, and Customer focused. All these four processes focus on how to improve effectiveness, efficiency, economy, responsiveness, quality and speed of the processes.</p>
<p><strong>14. International Marketing</strong></p>
<p><strong>International marketing</strong> is simply the application of marketing principles to more than one country.

The course will include how to develop a marketing strategy and plan; contribution to long-term expansion; overall competitiveness; exploiting unique technology and expertise; capital budgeting; devising  organization readiness; developing company export goals; target market considerations; advertising strategies, competitiveness factors, licensing, mergers, joint ventures etc.</p>
