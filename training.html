                    The AIRF course in strategic thinking focuses on how to find
                    and develop unique opportunities, to create innovative and
                    creative propositions at work place and value for the

                    dialogue among the internal stakeholders to affect change in

                    which uncovers potential opportunities for creating value

                    Strategic thinking is a way of analyzing and understanding
                    the current and future fundamental drivers of a business and
                    rigorously challenging conventional thinking for the better
                    future technical and financial performance and customer
                    results.

                    Customer service is an integral part of our job and should
                    not be seen as an extension of it. An organization’s most
                    vital asset is its customers. Without them, we would not and
                    could not exist in business. When you satisfy your
                    customers, they not only help you grow by continuing to do
                    business with them, but recommend you to friends and
                    associates. Good customer relationship management entails
                    careful customer care and building customer satisfaction,
                    loyalty and retaining them. Customer satisfaction and
                    loyalty are directly tied to the quality and value of your
                    services. Value of your services is measured by your
                    customer through technical and emotional attributes in
                    relation to the cost. In this course strategies for customer
                    care and customer relation management using Ten Commandments
                    of customer care will be dealt in detail.

                  </p>
                  <p class="p">
                    There are many reasons why you may want to negotiate and
                    there are several ways to approach it. A negotiation is an
                    interactive communication process that may take place
                    whenever we want something from someone else or another
                    person wants something from us. Negotiation is usually
                    considered as a compromise to settle an argument or issue to
                    benefit ourselves as much as possible and every one to leave
                    with a perception of a
                    Better-Alternative-To-A-Negotiated-Settlement. Communication
                    is always the link that will be used to negotiate the
                    issue/argument whether it is face-to-face, on the telephone
                    or in writing. Common mistakes during negotiation and
                    strategies including Ten Commandments for negotiation will
                    be taught in this course.

                    exposes participants to a range of models for preparing

                    and their programs for enhancing the performance of an
                    organization.&nbsp; This course starts from structuring the

                    a benefit vs. cost analysis of alternative policies and

                    responds to public opinion, and the role of experts in
                    policy-making. The course examines policy-making across

                    complex and demanding tasks. Therefore, there is a need to
                    maximize the caliber and contribution of each individual
                    employee in the work force. One must therefore, manage and
                    improve performance and optimize the efforts and
                    contribution of all employees to get the best from each
                    individual and that of the team.

                    Environmental management system refers to managing
                    organization’s environmental programs in a comprehensive
                    systematic, planning and documented manner. It includes
                    organizational structure, planning and resources for
                    developing and implementing and maintaining policy for
                    environmental protection from research to production and
                    distribution to disposal of given products.

                    Environmental management systems can assist an organization
                    to meet increasing demand for sustainable and clean
                    production, and increasing stakeholder pressure and
                    legislation against environmental pollution.&nbsp; In many
                    cases, the introduction of an environmental management
                    system can also aid cost savings, and reduction of
                    environmental liability.

                  <p class="p">
                    Transformation is defined as the fundamental rethinking and
                    radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic
                    improvements in critical contemporary measures of
                    performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed.
                    Transformation is a management approach aiming at
                    improvements by means of elevating efficiency and
                    effectiveness of the processes that exist within and across
                    organizations. Transformation derives its existence from
                    different disciplines such as organization, technology,
                    strategy, and people.&nbsp; The key to transformation is for
                    organizations to look at their business processes from a
                    “clean sheet” perspective and determine how they can best
                    construct these processes to improve business performance.

                  <p class="p">
                    This course elucidates four main types of processes which
                    can be transformed. Some processes are core and others are
                    non-core: namely Strategic, Operational, Managerial, and
                    Customer focused. All these four processes focus on how to
                    improve effectiveness, efficiency, economy, responsiveness,
                    quality and speed of the processes.

                    International marketing is simply the application of
                    marketing principles to more than one country. At its
                    simplest level, international marketing involves the firm in
                    making one or more marketing mix decisions across national
                    boundaries. At its most complex level, it involves the firm
                    in establishing manufacturing facilities overseas and
                    coordinating marketing strategies across the globe. The
                    course will include how to develop a marketing strategy and
